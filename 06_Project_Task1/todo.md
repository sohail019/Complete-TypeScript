## Landing Page (Login, Signup, Forget Password with Captcha):

- [ ] Create a Simple landing page
- [ ] User Authentication: Implement Login, Signup, Forget Password with Forms.
- [ ] **Captcha Validation** for security (will use library of react-google-recaptcha)
- [] **Role Based Authentication**: Different roles (admin, user) should determine the available options on the page..

## Update User Details (Without Refresh)
- [ ] **Form for updating user details:** Create a form where users can update their profile.
- [] **Instant updates**: using React's state and useEffect to re-render the UI after a successful API call.
- [] ** Confirmation dialog** before saving changes, and show a success message after saving.
- [] Consider using libraries like **React Query** for instant data sync after updates.

## User Details in Dialog
- On selecting a user, display their details in a modal dialog (can use libraries like @headlessui/react for modals).
- Fetch the user's details from the backend and populate the dialog.

## Dashboard with Graphical Data
- Graphical Representation: Use chart libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for pie charts, line graphs, etc.
- Add a dropdown to select the chart type.
- Stepper component: Create a stepper (can use Material-UI or custom-tailored TailwindCSS) for live tracking.

## Pagination with Data Grid
- User Listing with Pagination: Use a Data Grid library like react-data-grid for displaying the user list with pagination (handle 1, 2, 3â€¦ nth).
- Implement collapsible rows for detailed views.
- Make the table columns resizable.
- Start by scaffolding the project in React and integrating TailwindCSS. You can then proceed with each section as outlined. Let me know if you want help setting up or writing code for specific parts!
